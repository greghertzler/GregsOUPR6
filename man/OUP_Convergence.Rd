\description{
Monte-Carlo simulation to demonstrate different rates of convergence, rho.

\itemize{
\item year: time variable in annual increments for all sample paths
\item z1-z5: sample paths in sets of three, each set with the same pseudo-random shocks but different rates of convergence
}

The rate of convergence, rho, determines the probability distribution of the
estimated parameters and the correlation between two sets of parameters in
hypothesis tests.  Small rho tends toward Brownian Motion, which does not
converge.  Large rho tends toward a stationary or ergodic process which has
converged every time it is observed.  In between is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
Process which converges but has not yet converged.

Parameters for Browian Motion have an Erlang distribution.  Parameters for
a stationary or ergodic process have a Chi^2 distribution.  These distributions
are special cases of a Gamma distribution.  In general, parameters for the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process have a Gamma distribution.

The shape parameter, alpha, identifies the distribution with 0.5 <= alpha <=1. Chi^2
has alpha = 0.5.  Erlang has alpha = 1.
