<h2>Smoothed sample paths for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated and smoothed data to demonstrate the effect of smoothing on
parameter estimates.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>csv file with 177 rows and 11 columns
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> year: time variable in annual increments
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Data: simulated sample path
</p>
</li>
<li><p> G uno-G nueve: nine successively smoother paths
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Simulated data is smoothed ten times.  First, the parameters are estimated
and the means calculated for each observation. Then the calculated means
are used, as if they are data, in a subsequent estimation. Means are
calculated again and used in the next estimation and so on ten times.
The true rate of convergence, rho, and location, mu, are recovered from
each estimation, but the scale, sigma, goes toward zero.
</p>
<p>By the eighth smoothing, the log of the likelihood becomes positive. Hence,
the likelihood, as the anti-log, becomes greater than one. In other words,
if the eighth and ninth smoothings were real samples, the probability of
observing them would be greater than 100%. Further smoothings would increase
this probability.  A small sigma is a tell-tale sign the data has been smoothed.
A positive log likelihood is a sure sign.
</p>
<p>This is the best possible smoothing method. The model used for the smoothing
is consistent with the data. Surprisingly, hypothesis tests and decision
thresholds are not greatly affected.  However, passage times are calculated
to be much larger and are completely unreliable.
</p>
<p>The best possible smoothing is unlikely. Any model used to smooth the data is
probably not the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process.  The estimates will be wrong
and the actual system will be much more uncertain. How much more uncertain
is uncertain.
</p>
<p>Always use the raw data.
